currently: upload_postproc

packages can be uploaded with some command or can be automatically pulled from git https.
Config file contains 'include' (default [*]) or 'exclude' options to limit files.
Have namespaces where people can upload their stuff freely, and some moderation policy for global namespace packages.
    --> no, just run a dev server and let people add it as a source, it's easy
    --> maybe split into a pre-moderated and loosely-post-moderated one, too, but perhaps not immediately
Option to download packages from another package server

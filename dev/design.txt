NoTeX Package Index


How normally to select based on rest part? Which is latest?

- I can add some automatic license detection and then allow users to sort by common restrictions (viral, commercial)
- Make sure there's no circularity (perhaps through a generous max depth
-packages can be uploaded with some command or can be automatically pulled from git https.
 Config file contains 'include' (default [*]) or 'exclude' options to limit files.
 Have namespaces where people can upload their stuff freely, and some moderation policy for global namespace packages.
     --> no, just run a dev server and let people add it as a source, it's easy
     --> maybe split into a pre-moderated and loosely-post-moderated one, too, but perhaps not immediately
 Option to download packages from another package server

add hash checking after downloading package, make sure the hash is sent over https

validation and style checks when uploading
